# CrimeSpotter-AI

CrimeSpotter AI leverages the SlowFast model, trained on 1,230 videos from the UCF-Crime dataset, covering 14 classes including Abuse, Arrest, Arson, Assault, Burglary, Explosion, Fighting, Normal, Road Accidents, Robbery, Shooting, Shoplifting, Stealing, and Vandalism. 🎥

It processes each video by dividing it into eight segments and selects the highest anomaly score for precise classification. ⏱️

Using a simple binary threshold (≤0.5 = normal, >0.5 = suspicious), CrimeSpotter AI achieves 80% accuracy, enabling robust, real-time detection of suspicious activities in surveillance footage. 🚨
