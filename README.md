# CrimeSpotter-AI
CrimeSpotter AI leverages the power of the SlowFast model, trained on the UCF-Crime Dataset, to revolutionize surveillance by detecting anomalous actions with high precision. 
Utilizing 1,230 videos—equally split between normal and anomalous behaviors like arson, assault, fighting, and robbery—the system processes videos by dividing them into eight segments, selecting the highest prediction score for accurate classification. 
With a binary thresholding mechanism (≤0.5 for normal, >0.5 for suspicious), CrimeSpotter AI achieves an impressive 80% accuracy, making it a robust tool for enhancing security through real-time anomaly detection in surveillance footage. expand
